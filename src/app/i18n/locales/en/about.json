  "tab1_text": "Mapstories was created as part of a cooperation between re:edu GmbH & Co.KG and Vamos e.V.. The starting point of the project was the implementation of a co-creative lab on the global garment industry. Mapstories is a web-based open source tool that the students used to independently design an introduction to development education on the above-mentioned topic. The Mapstories can be used especially in the context of education for sustainable development due to the possibility of vividly creating systemic links and enable a comprehensive view of global issues",
